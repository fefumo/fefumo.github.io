Common use cases of hash sets include storing unique elements, marking elements as used or visited, and checking for duplicates.

In the description of a problem, pay attention to keywords like “frequency”, “unique”, “map”, “dictionary”, or “fast lookup”, because these often indicate that hash maps or sets could be useful.

> [!tip] Interview Tip
> Dont always jump straight to the most optimal or clever solution, as this won’t give the interviewer much insight into your problem-solving process. Consider multiple approaches, starting the the most straightforward ones, and gradually refine them. This way, you demonstrate your thought process and how you arrive at a more optimal solution.
