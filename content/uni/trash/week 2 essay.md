I would like to work in gitlab team because I like the freedom of open-source projects (I am a linux user myself), and I also think that this is a great way to improve the skills both as a backend developer and a team member. I also find the perks really beneficial, for instance, a global well-being platform providing Team Members discounts across well-being, fitness, and overall lifestyle offerings/services, which is completely free for team members.

I am looking for a good collaboration, equity, and a chance to grow within a talented and diverse team. As a passionate backend developer, I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to a dynamic and innovative environment like GitLab. I believe that working in a collaborative team setting would not only allow me to learn from experienced professionals but also provide me with opportunities to share my own ideas and perspectives.
