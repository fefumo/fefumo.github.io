School reunion

Hi Mark,

Since you skipped our school reunion, I just wanted to quickly tell you what happened there, as you told me to do so. 

  

To start with, I don’t really think that the park is a good place for that kind of party. There are children around and the atmosphere definitely did not seem to please the “hang out” vibes, you know. That kinda put me in a bad state of mind off the rip. Alice, who i 

  

So, the main part is – I was shocked by how everyone has grown up. Even though it’s only been 1 year, it felt like I was looking at strangers with familiar faces. Anyways, the first who came up to me and offered a drink, was our mutual friend Daniel (remember him?), who is now working as a barman while studying at the local university. Nothing interesting about him, really. The more I stood there, the more boring it seemed to me. 

  

Then Alice appeared and helped me to join the company and eventually have a good time. I don’t know how but she managed to cheer me up a bit, so she did make my evening. I can’t imagine what I would’ve done without her. So, we started sharing old memories from “golden times” and it was a lot of fun, honestly. Lots of people said that I always looked like a dweeb until that fight that happened between me and you in the 9th grade. Then we shared stories about all the teachers that we hated, especially the “math witch”.

  

To be honest, I really did have a good time with the classmates, despite the fact that at first it seemed to be the most boring evening of my life. I have to say, it’s sad that you did not come. But don’t worry though, if you decide to go there next time, (if you’re interested, I definitely will) I managed to put in a good word for you, not to mention that everyone wished to see you there. 

  

Have a good day man, hope you will write back.
