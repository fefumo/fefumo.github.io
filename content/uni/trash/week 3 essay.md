To start with, I have to say that there wasn’t anything that particularly surprised me, however I do think the video is well structured and the tips that are given are applicable in real life. In fact, I use most of them.

The best  advice  to me is investing in your setup. I haven’t had a desk to work at for my first two years of university, and even though I thought I could do everything on my laptop while lying on my bed, I was completely wrong. 

So, as I’ve mentioned, I’ve invested in my setup, but apart from that I’ve been doing lots of other pieces of advice. For example, I learned to debug almost at the very beginning as it’s the most crucial skill a developer must have. I also do try to take other people’s ideas (copy them) and apply to my projects.
