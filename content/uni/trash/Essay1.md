In the two texts provided, two differing opinions are presented, both of which I will discuss in this essay.

The first author explains the reasoning behind the imperfection of tools and furniture in our homes. They agree with the quote that having only useful and beautiful things is a good idea; however, most people cannot achieve that ideal. An example is given of a glass bowl which they cannot throw away because it was received as a present. Personally, I believe that nothing in our lives should be perfect, so it is completely acceptable to have a few useless things here and there. It is simply important to find the golden middle between being a person living in a cluttered flat and an absolute perfectionist who owns nothing but a bottle of water and a chair in the entire living room.

The second author discusses the meaning of "home" to individuals. They firmly believe that "your home is what you yourself make it." I partially agree with this statement, as there are too many variables that influence what makes a place a home. For some, home could be a temporary place they return to out of necessity (such as immigrants), while for others, it is the place where they were born. Therefore, I believe that everyone should be allowed to define what "home" means for themselves.
